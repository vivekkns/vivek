}
% , Network Programming
% , Rapid prototyping, Debugging, Code review and mentoring.

% From the age of eighteen, I have been involved in designing and building software. This also includes over ten years of professional experience as an engineer and consultant re-architecting software frameworks and leading engineering teams. My professional background is in the development of scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed systems that have high reliability even in cases of latency-sensitive front ends and APIs. I have a wide range of experience in various programming languages and platforms.

\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{Pluribus Networks, Bangalore}
\descript{| Senior Software Engineer}
\location{2017 - Present}
I work on an architecture which simplifies our clients’ software-defined data centers by virtualizing networking hardware, enabling them to build scalable and secure private and public clouds.
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space

\begin{tightitemize}
\item \textit{Super Fabric}: Solved the hyperscalability problem of scaling the decentralised 4-phase transaction framework, to 64 nodes and beyond
\item Solved the scalability problem on heterogeneous cluster of nodes by re-architecting the product using the \textit{worker-thread model}
\item Developed a distributed framework for upgrading multiple nodes, thereby reducing network downtime and enhancing customer experience
\item Reduced product memory consumption by 7x or more, by \textit{implementing} a more efficient \textit{hash table} that improved scalability
\item Forged the system in performance, by troubleshooting activities like memory leak fixes, file system issues etc. that improved overall efficiency
\end{tightitemize}

\runsubsection{Enterprise Management software for Universities}
\descript{| Creator}
\location{2012-13}
Developed a software that digitized the operations of the student cafeteria at the reputed \textit{Indian Institute of Management - Lucknow}, which caters to a community of over a thousand people. Features of the software included inventory management, billing, fraud prevention, record keeping, and accounting. It resulted in significant cost savings of \textit{INR 4 million} annually for the university community.
